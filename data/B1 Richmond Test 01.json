        "transcript": "Hi everyone.\nThis morning I want to give you a brief summary of the great walking trip we had last weekend, hiking in the hills of Todmore.\nThere were twelve of us in the group, and we set off at 7.30 on Saturday. The weather at the beginning was beautiful - very sunny - but it had been raining a lot before that.\nThe paths had already dried out, so they weren’t a problem, but the streams were very full and getting across them was a challenge - a lot of wet feet!\nWe walked eight miles in the morning and saw lots of wildlife. There were the usual rabbits and plenty of beautiful birds. And we were even lucky enough to see a kind of flower that’s hardly ever seen these days, especially in this part of the world.\nWe stopped off to visit a castle and stayed a while to enjoy the beautiful views from the top.\nAfter another hour’s walk, we stopped for our picnic lunch by a farm which has been ruined for many years - a very beautiful and peaceful place.\nHowever, just after we had packed away our things, the weather suddenly changed and there was a thunderstorm, which meant we couldn’t start walking again for about twenty minutes.\nBut once it had finished, we were able to carry on along the route that we had planned for the afternoon. We saw the famous cliff above the river, but the thing people said they enjoyed the most was the waterfall, which is one of the highest in the country.\nWe finished the hike by taking a great picture of the group outside the café where we’d stopped for an excellent tea at the end of the walk, before getting the coach back at 5.30.",

        "transcript": "Our guest today is Alfie Jones, who’s a journalist. How did you get the job, Alfie?\nI thought I’d become a librarian after finishing university. But at university, I did some part-time work serving customers in a department store, and the boss asked me to write some articles about the business. I enjoyed it and decided to apply for the job I do now on a local newspaper, reporting on businesses in the region.\n\nInterviewer: What do you find most difficult about your job?\nAlfie: Sometimes it's really difficult to get the facts I need for a story. That takes time.\n\nInterviewer: What has changed for journalists in the last 20 years?\nAlfie: ...same number of employees... but in the past... half... outside the office. That’s very rare nowadays.\n\nInterviewer: How do you feel about being the youngest member of staff?\nAlfie: When I got the job, I'd expected there to be lots of staff my age at the office, but it didn't bother me when I found there weren't any. Someone has to be the youngest, and no one should feel bad about having the chance to learn from more experienced people. It's amazing, but people sometimes ask me things, like how to use new technologies.\n\nInterviewer: So if someone wants to be a journalist, what should this person do?\nAlfie: Well, some people say the most important thing is to be confident and put lots of stuff online. That's what everyone does these days and it won't make you different. Instead, you need to be curious and look at what's written about in the news. So when you come to apply to newspapers or other media, you'll be able to show how much you know.\n\nInterviewer: What are your plans for the future?\nAlfie: If possible, I'd like to work as a radio journalist. I think I'd have more freedom and be able to choose my own stories. It's not that I want to change direction and move into something like international news. I'm happy writing about business, and I think I'm good at it.",

I was surprised to discover exactly how much clothes change over time and across different situations. Obviously, we think of clothes as being important - to keep us warm or to protect us from the sun, for example. But in early history, people often wore clothes for religious reasons and not necessarily for protection, so the designs had a different purpose.<br><br>Later, when I went to do my degree at college, I did a survey looking at how we judge people and their jobs based on what they are wearing. The results were unexpected. For example, despite the fact that dress has generally become more casual in the twenty-first century, many people simply couldn't imagine that someone in jeans might be running a company. So, although it may seem that what people wear to work doesn't matter so much today, clothes are actually still seen as a sign of someone's profession.<br><br>After college, I started work doing designs for films and the theatre. Many of these were historical and what was extraordinary was the number of clothes in the past which were simply designed for beauty rather than for practical reasons. And of course, ideas change very quickly so what is considered lovely by one generation is considered ugly by the next.<br><br>I have to understand all of this because when I'm creating costumes for films and plays, I really need to study the time period carefully and consider what was fashionable at the time. For example, did most men have beards? How easy was it for queens to move around in their dresses? And if at really interesting times, people think that the poorest people have worn to enable them to work all day on different historical films. That's what gives me the most pleasure - dressing the crowds or the servants in items and making sure I give an accurate picture of their lives on screen."
